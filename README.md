# Therapy Session Assistant

The **Therapy Session Assistant** is an AI-powered tool designed to help therapists engage more effectively with their patients and streamline the therapy process. It analyzes patient speech, generates session summaries, and adjusts the environment with music to create a more comfortable and focused therapeutic setting. This system integrates three key agents: Audio Agent, Mood Detection, and Music Curation.

- **Mood Detection**: Analyzes the sentiment of the transcribed speech to detect emotional states.
- **Session Summary Generation**: Summarizes the therapy session with insights into emotional states, progress, and therapeutic goals.
- **Music Curation**: Plays music to enhance the patient’s comfort and mood based on detected emotions.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly web interface for therapists to interact with the system.

## Benefits

- **Improved Engagement**: Real-time insights into the patient’s emotional state allow therapists to adjust their approach during the session.
- **Session Efficiency**: AI-generated summaries provide a quick overview of the conversation, saving time for therapists and ensuring important details are captured.
